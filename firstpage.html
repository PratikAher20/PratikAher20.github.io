            My First Page   <!--Updates the title of the web page-->
        </title>

    <body>
        <!--content goes in the body-->
        <h1> Hey HTML, I am Here!!</h1> <!--H1 down to H6 are different levels of heading-->
        <p> This will come on the first paragraph. Now to bold the words we can simply use <b> BOLD </b>
        to bold the letters in the line.</p>
        <p>And this will turn out onto the second paragraph. We can also bold the letters using 
            <strong> STRONG Keyword</strong> which does the same thing. Now to make the letters italic
            we can use <em> EM keyword</em> or we can also use <i>I element</i>.
        </p>

            This is the next paragraph in which we will learn about making lists in html. Order and unOrder lists
            . Ordered list has numbers ordered. But the unorderd does not have that. Here is the example of the ordered lists
            <ol>
                <li>Red</li>
                <li>Yellow</li>
                <li>Blue</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>Red</li>
                <li>Yellow</li>
                <li>Blue</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <p> Learning div and span. Both of them are useful in styling. Allow us to group content or things together.
        Without styling the div tab would not look anything different. div takes its own line but span does not.
        So the conclusion is that span is inline container whereas the div is more generic container.

        In this para we will study about HTML attributes. Attributes means adding additional information to 
        the tags. It has a name and a value for that corresponding name.
        There are many attributes, but the important of them are src and href as they contains various elements.
        <ol>
            <li>Images</li>
            <p>
                <img src = "starship.jpeg">
                <p>Instead of the local image file we can also specifiy the already hosted image on the web.
                So instead of the name of the image just paste the link of it.</p>
            </p>
            <li> Anchor Tags...Links</li>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">Take me to spaceX website</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly to the hosted websites we can also link some other html pages which are not hosted 
                and are local to the PC.
                <a href="new_page.html">Lets go to another page</a>
            </p>
        </ol>
    </p>
