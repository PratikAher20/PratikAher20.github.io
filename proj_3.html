  Along with the ground station operations in fifth semester, I also focused on developing and configuring some open source softwares to process the telemetry data 
  received through beacons. After configuring the softwares to decode the telemetry packets and telecommand to INSPIRESat-1, I also developed 
  a GUI using which we can automate the process of configuring that open source software. So by now I had some skills to developed ground station 
  softwares and de-packetize the raw telemetry packets sent using CCSDS format. All this activites were done along with the academics. This would 
  be my first semester where in I have focused equally on buildling other skills while progressing through the academic studies. Fifth semester 
  was over and I was back at my home for a winter vacation. It was only a month of break after which our sixth semester followed by internship was
  about to commence. During vacation time our result was out and I scored a GPA of 9.03 which was very much satisfactory for me. Now I had that 
  confidence to manage my academics along with the SSPACE and ground station activities. One day after results, on 27th December 2022 I got a call 
  from our senior who was asking me to contribute to the mission called PiLOT which was to be launched soon. My job was to help our seniors for 
  writing the flight software and carrying out ground support tests for the software. Without any hesitation, I accepted his offer and was very happy. On that day 
  I realized that if I am sincere to my work, other people will believe and trust me and ultimately include me in such great missions. Missions which 
  are soon to be launched are not very easy to handle. The biggest difficult is to deal with the timing constraint. My seniors were confident, that no 
  matter what happens I would complete the work within the stipulated time. The next semester was my sixth semester of academics. I had no clue how 
  hard or how easy it could be. But still I decided to completely focus on the PiLOT mission. This was the only semester in which I was slightly relaxed 
  with the academics.

  Me along with my senior started discussing about the codes for the software. The drivers for many of the sensors present on various boards were 
  already completed by my senior. So the major part which was remaining was to interface our payload to POEM stage modules which will capture the data 
  generated by our payload and then transmit it back to ISRO ground stations. Along with interfacing with the POEM packages we also had 
  to design the software architecture. This all was taken care by my senior and with him I used to disucss some possible failure scenarios and discuss 
  the architecture and several other methods to meet the challenges. Designing the packet structure and packetizing the raw data into it was completed. 
  After this was done, I started configuring the ground support software using which we will test the software and check whether the values which we are receiving are correct or not. 
  When the flight boards were available all the boards were connected separately and tested. We usually call this test setup as FlatSat wherein all the 
  boards are layed on flat surface and connected with each other using jumpers. All the night we spent testing the hardware and software over it.
  After making it work finally, we took some pictures which clearly showed the satisfaction of the work on our faces.

  All the prilimanary testings were done. There was very less time and many good architectures of the software and its sub-module could have been 
  implemented. But due to lack of time we stick to the easiest and simple to implement approach. Doing this there were few problem which we faced later 
  during testing the data integrity with the Flight Module POEM packages. As I was with the team throughout the mission, I was able to note down 
  all the problems and difficulties faced during this mission. This indeed help me, because many of the problems which we faced during PiLOT-1 mission 
  was rectified during PiLOT-G2/ GRACE mission which will be discussed later. Most of the flight boards were fabricated and we were told to 
  do a Data integrity test with the POEM packages systems. This was the first time I was visiting VSSC Centre of ISRO. The testing went well and we 
  took a huge breath of relief. Although we could not get the data which we generated during that testing but we were sure that our data is not interrupting 
  any other payload channel's data.

  Working under a mission not only involves taking care of one subsystem but also helping and checking other subsystems works. Structure of the PiLOT
  payload was of the size of 1U (10cm x 10cm x 10cm). All the PCB's (Printed Circuit Boards) were also designed to be in the same form factor. When 
  a dummy structure was available, we performed a dummy integration with the boards. Flight structure was to be 3-D printed by LnT. Once the flight 
  structure was delivered by LnT we visited ELIX centre at LPSC for the mechanical integration of our payload. During that phase our Quiz 2 exams were going on.
  It was my RFIC exam on the next day and I was with my PiLOT team for the mechanical integration of our payload. Even PD sir captured my picture while 
  studying for quizzes during mechanical integration. But he never forced me to focus on the work and leave the exam. After completing the integration at that night 
  I finally moved to my hostel room. It was about 11:30pm in the night. I was fully exhausted on that day so I decided to take rest and 
  study in the morning for the exam. On the next day after waking up at 5am in the morning I again started revising the syllabus and prepared well 
  for the exam. Still I was little messed up with my preparations because I never had this habit of preparing for the exams a day before the exam.
  The exam went well and after the results came my score was above 80%. I was satisfied and was also a bit of nervous. I was nervous because I knew 
  I could have done much better than what I have been doing since my starting of the sixth semester.

  After the mechanical integration the payload was moved to QDTE lab at VSSC. It was a weekend and due to elective courses during sixth semester, I 
  did not had exam for atleast next six days. All the pre-flight testings on the payload was carried out to qualify our payload for launch on PSLV-C55 rocket.
  After my classes were finished, I moved on to VSSC to take part in all the QDTE testings and get more experience from all my teammates as well as the 
  staff of VSSC who were guiding us for doing all the testings on our payload. Those five to six days were of complete new experience for me.
  I got to interact with many ISRO scientists and work with them to test our payload. I also got a chance to visit all the testing facilites at VSSC 
  and test our payload using that facility. The testings used to take lot of time so we divided our team into two groups and were working day and night 
  to qualify our payload. PD sir also used to stay with us at VSSC guest house. Everyday for dinner he used to give us some treat in whichever restraunt we want.
  We all also enjoyed the lunch and high tea's at VRC mess at VSSC and VSSC hill top restraunt. During the free time we also roam around the beaches 
  and churches around the VSSC guest house.

  Once the QDTE testings were over the payload was immediately shifted to SDSC (Satish Dhawan Space Centre), SHAR. Electrical and Mechanical team 
  from our seniors lead the payload to its launch destiantion at the spaceport of India. All the electrical checks were completed and the payload was taken to
  the fourth stage of PSLV-C55 rocket. All the electrical testings were carried with the flight hardware on the POEM platform. It was first experience 
  for most of us to watch the rocket and all its stages in front of our eyes. After the first team returned back, the second team including me 
  went for the mechanical integration checks at SHAR. It was my first time to watch the rocket so closely and even touch it. Before moving in to the 
  MST tower we were given instructions about how to escape the building in case of fuel leakage or any emergency situation. We were taken to the fourth 
  stage of the rocket where the satellites were intergrated with the fourth stage of the rocket. It was a clean room and so we were instructed to wear 
  the required constume to get into that clean room. Once we were into that room, I took a closer look at each and every systems which are used to 
  intergrate the satellite with the rocket stage. Once PD sir told that, there are very few people in ISRO who actually gets chance to see all this 
  things which we were observing even without being a ISRO scientist. That moment was a million times prestigious moment for me!!!!

  All the hard work, many sleepless nights, 100% dedication was taking flight on 22rd April 2023. Yes it was a launch day, and me with my seniors 
  organised a small launch party at SSPACE lab. I still remember that I buncked Digital Communications extra class to feel the excitement to watch the rocket and 
  our payload launch into the space. All the goosebumps, excitement and thrill during the launch made the experience fantastic. After few orbits we 
  started getting data. All the systems were working nominally and now were qualified as space grade equipments. The software which our team designed 
  worked properly except few deviations which were known during the testing phase itself. The data analysis of the science part was carried out 
  after a processed data was released from the software team. I learnt a lot during this mission and decided to overcome many challenges which we 
  faced while designing and testing the software for it. I was also able to mitigate some major challenges which we later used in our future payload 
  mission which will be discussed in the next project section. If you have sticked with the article and have came till here, I just want to share one 
  thing with you all. When you are working on a mission along with a team, do try to give your best no matter if other team members supports you or not, 
  no matter if you will get good outputs from this mission or not. Just give your 100% and feel the satisfaction of working to your atmost strength 
  to make the mission successful.
